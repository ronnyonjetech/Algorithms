## Table of Contents

### ðŸ“Œ Physical Data Structures
Structures that define **how data is stored in memory** (actual representation).  
- [Array](#array) â†’ Data stored in a contiguous memory block.  
- [Linked List](./LinkedLists/) â†’ Data stored in nodes connected with pointers.

- [Stack](#stack) â†’ Follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).  
- [Queue](#queue) â†’ Follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO).  
- [Tree](#tree) â†’ Hierarchical structure (parentâ€“child relationship).  
- [Graph](#graph) â†’ Network of nodes connected by edges.
