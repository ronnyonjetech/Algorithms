# Data Structures

Before diving into algorithms, it’s important to first study **data structures**.  
The reason is simple: **algorithms are built on top of data structures**. 

### Physical Data Structures
Structures that define **how data is stored in memory** (actual representation).
Physical data structures are used **to build the logical data structures**.
Array and Linked List can create stack,queues,trees and graphs therefore you have to master them first
- [Array](#array) → Data stored in a contiguous memory block.  
- [Linked List](./LinkedLists/) → Data stored in nodes connected with pointers.

### Logical Data Structures
Structures that define **how data elements are logically organized and accessed**, independent of memory.  
- [Stack](#stack) → Follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).  
- [Queue](#queue) → Follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO).  
- [Tree](#tree) → Hierarchical structure (parent–child relationship).  
- [Graph](#graph) → Network of nodes connected by edges.
