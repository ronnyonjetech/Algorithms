## Table of Contents

###  Physical Data Structures
Structures that define **how data is stored in memory** (actual representation).  
- [Array](#array) → Data stored in a contiguous memory block.  
- [Linked List](./LinkedLists/) → Data stored in nodes connected with pointers.

###  Logical Data Structures
Structures that define **how data elements are logically organized and accessed**, independent of memory.  
- [Stack](#stack) → Follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).  
- [Queue](#queue) → Follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO).  
- [Tree](#tree) → Hierarchical structure (parent–child relationship).  
- [Graph](#graph) → Network of nodes connected by edges.
